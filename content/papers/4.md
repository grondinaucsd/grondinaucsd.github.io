##### Abstract

We investigate under what conditions sustainable investing—financial i nvestors w ho like
(resp. dislike) holding assets that they believe have a positive (resp. negative) environmental/
societal impact— alter the allocation of capital between clean and dirty firms in a dynamic
general equilibrium framework. We show that investors with preferences for sustainable investing
can have both a composition and a scale impact on output, but the magnitude, the direction,
and the timing of the impacts crucially depend on the size of sustainable investors in terms of
stock market wealth, their investment horizon, and the distribution of firms across sustainability
scores. While sustainable investing is shown to eventually impact capital allocation in favor of
clean firms in the long run, it might take a long time before the positive impact materializes.
