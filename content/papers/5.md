##### Abstract

We derive equivalence results in dynamic models with information frictions to
help solve for equilibriumand facilitate interpretation. Our primary theoremdelivers
an equivalence, in the aggregate, betweenmodels with dispersed and hierarchical
information. Optimal signal extraction, in the dispersed case, suggests agents
treat the signal as true with probability equal to the signal-to-noise ratio, and false
with the complementary probability. Equivalence follows when the share of informed
agents, in the hierarchical model, is set equal to the signal-to-noise ratio in
the dispersed economy. The value of this theorem is due to the hierarchical model
being much easier to solve and interpret, especially when agents infer information
from endogenous sources. We also generalize the ubiquitous Hansen-Sargent formula
to models with incomplete information and derive equivalence-class representations
as a function of information. We use our results to study the behavior
of higher-order beliefs and information transmission in closed forminmodels with
dispersed information and endogenous signal extraction.
