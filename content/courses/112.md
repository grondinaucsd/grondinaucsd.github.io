## Introduction

The courses examines time series methods for data analysis with an emphasis on macroeconomic
applications. The aim of the class is to provide students with a basic formal introduction to modern
time series techniques, hands-on experience in applying them to real-world macroeconomic data, and
understanding of how to bring data to bear on policy-relevant macroeconomic theories.

## Module 1: Fundamentals of Time Series

Module 1 begins with a quick review of random variables, and hypothesis testing. It then introduces the basic elements of univariate time-series analysis: covariance stationarity, white noise process, moving averages, and autoregressive processes.

## Module 2: Estimation, Inference, and Prediction

Module 2 studies the estimation of linear time-series models and their use for inference and for prediction.

## Module 3: Non-Stationarity, Trends, and Cycles

Module 3 studies the properties of non-stationary time series, and analyzes alternative measures of trends and cycles.

## Module 4: Multivariate Time Series

Module 4 studies vector autoregressions (VARs), starting with reduced-form analysis, and introducing structural VARs via the equations ordering (Cholesky Decomposition) approach.

## Module 5: Cointegration and Spurious Regressions

Module 5 studies nonstationarity in a multivariate setting, analyzing spurious regressions, and cointegration.

## Optimal control

This section starts by formulating the consumption-saving problem in continuous time. We solve this continuous-time problem first by using a present-value Hamiltonian, and then by using a current-value Hamiltonian. (Both approaches are equivalent.) Then we discuss optimality conditions for general optimization problems solved by optimal control. To conclude, we discuss the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

## Differential equations

In this section we first solve linear first-order differential equations. We then move to linear systems of first-order differential equations. Next we discuss how we can derive the properties of a linear system of first-order differential equations by drawing its phase diagram. Finally, we turn to nonlinear systems of first-order differential equations---which are common in macroeconomics. Although we cannot solve them explicitly, we characterize their properties by constructing their phase diagrams.

## Conclusion

To conclude, a little more practice and an application. The problem set below brings together all the material from the course. And the paper below applies the course's techniques to analyze the New Keynesian model in normal times and at the zero lower bound. The analysis covers in particular the response to recessionary shocks, the effects of forward guidance, and the effects of government spending.
