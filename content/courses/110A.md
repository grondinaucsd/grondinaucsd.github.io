## Introduction

Why is the typical American today 10 times richer than the typical American a century ago? Why
are some countries much richer than others? Why do some countries grow fast and catch up with the
richest countries while others remain stagnant? Can standards of living keep increasing indefinitely?
These are arguably among the most important questions studied in macroeconomics. In Econ 110A
we will learn how macroeconomists' approach to such questions has evolved over time, what we have
come to learn, and what we still only partially understand about the macroeconomy in the long-run.

## Module 1: Dynamic Decision-Making, Efficiency, and Intergenerational Equity

## Lecture 2: Sustainability Criteria

Lecture 2 reviews the axiomatic approach to intertemporal preferences and lays out four sustainability criteria: undiscounted utility (Ramsey criterion); maximin (Rawls criterion); the Green Golden Rule; and the Chichilnisky criterion. The criteria are applied to dynamic models with non-renewable and renewable resources.

## Lecture 3: Sustainability with Reproducible Capital

Lecture 3 studies the Daspupta-Heal-Stiglitz-Solow model of growth with reproducible capital and natural resources and applies to it the sustainability criteria developed in Lecture 2. It reviews the Hartwick's Rule
and relates that to sustainability and genuine savings.
