## Introduction

The course is a short introduction to the analytical tools and basic results in the theory of economic sustainability
from a macroeconomic perspective. The class begins by reviewing dynamic decision-making in continuous time, efficiency, and intergenerational
equity. It then reviews the axiomatic approach to intergenerational preferences and presents alternative sustainability criteria, which are subsequently applied to macroeconomic models with non-renewable and renewable resources, and with reproducible capital. It finally explores the implications of sustainability criteria for national accounting practices.

## Lecture 1: Dynamic Decision-Making, Efficiency, and Intergenerational Equity

Lecture 1 presents a review of dynamic decision-making in continuous time, the competing notions of efficiency and intergenerational equity, and an overview of the macroeconomic approach to sustainability.

## Lecture 2: Sustainability Criteria

Lecture 2 reviews the axiomatic approach to intertemporal preferences and lays out four sustainability criteria: undiscounted utility (Ramsey criterion); maximin (Rawls criterion); the Green Golden Rule; and the Chichilnisky criterion. The criteria are applied to dynamic models with non-renewable and renewable resources.

## Module 3: Non-Stationarity, Trends, and Cycles

Module 3 studies the properties of non-stationary time series, and analyzes alternative measures of trends and cycles.

## Module 4: Multivariate Time Series

Module 4 studies vector autoregressions (VARs), starting with reduced-form analysis, and introducing structural VARs via the equations ordering (Cholesky Decomposition) approach.
