## Introduction

The course is a short introduction to the analytical tools and basic results in the theory of economic sustainability
from a macroeconomic perspective. The class begins by reviewing dynamic decision-making in continuous time, efficiency, and intergenerational
equity. It then reviews the axiomatic approach to intergenerational preferences and presents alternative sustainability criteria, which are subsequently applied to macroeconomic models with non-renewable and renewable resources, and with reproducible capital. It finally explores the implications of sustainability criteria for national accounting practices.

## Module 1: Fundamentals of Time Series

Module 1 begins with a quick review of random variables, and hypothesis testing. It then introduces the basic elements of univariate time-series analysis: covariance stationarity, white noise process, moving averages, and autoregressive processes.

## Module 2: Estimation, Inference, and Prediction

Module 2 studies the estimation of linear time-series models and their use for inference and for prediction.

## Module 3: Non-Stationarity, Trends, and Cycles

Module 3 studies the properties of non-stationary time series, and analyzes alternative measures of trends and cycles.

## Module 4: Multivariate Time Series

Module 4 studies vector autoregressions (VARs), starting with reduced-form analysis, and introducing structural VARs via the equations ordering (Cholesky Decomposition) approach.
